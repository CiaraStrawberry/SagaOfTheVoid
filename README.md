# SagaOfTheVoid
The CodeBase for SagaOftheVoid
This is essentially the full codebase for Saga of the Void.
It was written for mostly 80 hour work weeks for the last 2 years, and was started when i was not as good as i am now so it is mostly completely nuts.
you need the rest of the assets to make it work and those are nearly 20gb so they arent here
