# SagaOfTheVoid

This is essentially the full, documented codebase for Saga of the Void.

The full project is 20gb so i cannot put it here sadly...

I code with a 34 inch 21:9 monitor so i dont avoid writing long lines when writing for myself, so expect that.

The most important bits are contained within the "Controllers" folder, so i would go there first.
