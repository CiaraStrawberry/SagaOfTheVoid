# SagaOfTheVoid
The CodeBase for SagaOftheVoid.

This is essentially the full codebase for Saga of the Void.

It was written for mostly 80 hour work weeks for the last 2 years, and was started when i was not a particularly great programmer
so the base is frankly quite unorganised and containts some low quality code.

you need the rest of the assets to make it work and those are nearly 20gb so they are not here.
